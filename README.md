# Implementation of Logistic Regression Model for Classifying Food Choices for Diabetic Patients

## AIM:
To implement a logistic regression model to classify food items for diabetic patients based on nutrition information.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Load Data: Import the dataset and inspect column names.
2.Prepare Data: Separate features (X) and target (y).
3.Split Data: Divide into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
4.Scale Features: Standardize the data using StandardScaler.
5.Train Model: Fit a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
6.Make Predictions: Predict on the test set.
7.Evaluate Model: Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and classification report.
8.Confusion Matrix: Compute and visualize confusion matrix.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
file_path = r'C:\Users\admin\Downloads\food_items_binary.csv'  # Ensure the path is corrected
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Print column names
print("Column Names in the Dataset:")
print(data.columns)

# Separate features (X) and target (y)
X = data.drop(columns=['class'])  # Nutritional information as features
y = data['class']  # Target: 1 (suitable), 0 (not suitable)

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

# Standardize the features for better performance
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train the Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Predict the classifications on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
evaluation_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

# Compute confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# Print results
print(f"\nAccuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.2f}")
print("\nClassification Report:\n", evaluation_report)

# Plot the confusion matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=['Not Suitable', 'Suitable'], yticklabels=['Not Suitable', 'Suitable'])
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.show()
```
